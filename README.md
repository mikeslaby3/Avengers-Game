With Avengers End Game coming out soon, I felt that creating an Avengers themed game was only right!
The game involves using your memory and simple math to defeat Thanos.

Rules:
Thanos is given a random amount of health and each Avenger is given a random damage value that is unknown to the user until they attack.
The goal is inflict the exact amount of damage as Thanos has health and do so six times, one for each Infinity Stone.
If you go over the target health of Thanos, you lose. Lose 10 times and the game is over.
Each time you win or lose, Thanos' health and the Avengers damage values are reset.

Good luck, the fate of the world is counting on you!
